/// RefineableElements are FiniteElements that may be subdivided into 
/// children to provide a better local approximation to the solution. 
/// After non-uniform refinement adjacent elements need not necessarily have
/// nodes in common. A node that does not have a counterpart in its
/// neighbouring element is known as a hanging node and its position and
/// any data that it stores must be constrained to ensure inter-element
/// continuity. 
///
/// Generic data and function interfaces associated with refinement 
/// are defined in this class.
/// 
/// Additional data includes:
/// - a pointer to a general Tree object that is used to track the
///   refinement history,
/// - a refinement level (not necessarily the same as the level in the tree!),
/// - a flag indicating whether the element should be refined,
/// - a flag indicating whether the element should be de-refined,
/// - a global element number for plotting/validation  purposes,
/// - storage for local equation numbers associated with hanging nodes.
///
/// Additional functions perform the following generic tasks:
/// - provide access to  additional data,
/// - setup local equation numbering for data associated with hanging nodes,
/// - generic finite-difference calculation of contributions to the 
///   elemental jacobian from nodal data to include hanging nodes,
/// - split of the element into its sons,
/// - select and deselect the element for refinement,
/// - select and deselect the sons of the element for de-refinement (merging),
///
/// In addition, there are a number of interfaces that specify element-specific
/// tasks. These should be overloaded in RefineableElements of particular
/// geometric types and perform the following tasks:
/// - return a pointer to the root and father elements in the tree structure,
/// - define the number of sons into which the element is divided,
/// - build the element: construct nodes, assign their positions, 
///   values and any boundary conditions,
/// - recreate the element from its sons if they are merged,
/// - deactivate the element, perform any operations that are 
///   required when the element is still in the tree, but no longer active 
/// - set the number and provide access to the values interpolated
///   by the nodes,
/// - setup the hanging nodes
///  
/// In mixed element different sets of nodes are used to interpolate different
/// unknowns. Interfaces are provided for functions that can be used to find
/// the position of the nodes that interpolate the different unknowns. These
/// functions are used to setup hanging node information automatically in
/// particular elements, e.g. Taylor Hood Navier--Stokes. 
/// The default implementation assumes that the elements are isoparameteric.
