\mainpage Demo problem: Relaxation oscillations of a fluid layer

Detailed documentation to be written. Here's a plot of the result
and the already fairly well documented driver code...

@I w 0.75\textwidth single_layer_flow "Velocity and pressure fields "


@I w 0.75\textwidth single_layer_trace "Time-trace of the height of the fluid layer at the left end of the domain "

\include single_layer.cc
