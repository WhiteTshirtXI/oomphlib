\mainpage Demo problem: Spin-up of a viscous fluid -- the spatially adaptive solution of the unsteady axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations

Detailed documentation to be written; well-documented driver code
is at the end of this document.

The key feature of this problem is the fact that the flow field
approaches a "trivial" solution (rigid body rotation) which can be
fully-resolved by the discretsation. In that case, equidistribution of
the error (normalised by the norm of the global error which tends to
zero!) leads to strong uniform mesh refinement as the solution
approaches the trivial solution. To avoid this, it is possible to
set a constant reference value error norm.
